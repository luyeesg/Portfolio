            Back in 2020, Apple surprised the world in the WWDC by announcing
            the transition away from using Intel in favor of Apple silicon. At
            the end of that same year, Apple launched their new ARM-based chips
            that shocked everyone due to the power of the Apple silicon. The M1
            chip was faster, more power-efficient, and had better battery life
            for their laptops than Intel chips.
          </p>
          <p class="article">
            Although all these things weren't only benefits. Due to the
            incompatibility between ARM-based chips and the Intel x86
            architecture Apple had to dropped support for Windows Boot Camp
            which was the main way to run games on Mac. Adding that Apple also
            dropped support for 32-bits apps so from one day to another hundreds
            of games couldn't run on Mac things weren't looking good for gaming
            on Apple Silicon.
          </p>
          <p class="article">
            These last two years the community has been trying to improve the
            gaming experience on Mac by creating compatibility layers like
            Crossover, emulators, and virtual machines so this is where State of
            Mac comes in.
